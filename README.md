## FAQ
### Is this app safe?
Yes. If youâ€™re still unsure, the source code can be fully viewed on this repository. You might get a warning from macOS when first opening it up. This happens because our app disables Appleâ€™s app sandbox in order to use the Discord SDK.

### How does it work?
Simply open up the app and play any song on Apple Music. You should see on your discord profile the song, artist and album names.

### Can I contribute to the project? 
Sure! You can contribute by filing issues or opening PRs right here.

### Who made this app?
My name is Lucas GusmÃ£o and Iâ€™m a developer! You can check more of my stuff out at [lucasalgus.dev](https://lucasalgus.dev). I am in no way affiliated with Apple or Discord.
